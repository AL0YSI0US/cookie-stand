+ My accountability buddies are very important to me, I learn so much from them as well as my fellow classmates.
+ Finding a better method for planning out my wireframes is something that would be very helpful when I get to the stages of appending elements to the DOM
+ Starting with a Constructor function set up from the begining must be a game changer, It's also helpful to know what is happening deeper within the code.
+ I spent a lot of time learning the structure of a table trig to figiure out how to get one to manifest itself.
