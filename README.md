## Cookie-Stand

**Hello there**,

Welcome to **Pat's' Cookie Stand**!

Here you can find Pat's' digital storefront for his various cookies store locations. There are three pages to check out:

1. Home page **Pat's Salmon Cookies'**
2. **Salmon Cookie Storefront** [Coming Soon Disclaimer]
3. **Salmon Cookie Sales Data** [Sales data by the hour]

On Pats homepage you can take a peek at store information broken down by each branch. At the bottom of the page you can see what our new shirtslook like [*they're available in store should you feel inclned to pick yourself up one today*]

At the Sales data page if you refresh the page you will see the numbers chage...this is because pat's calculating the average sales by the hour and including a randomly generated number of customers in his math.

To top it all of **YOU** can add your very own store location to the table, just answer the prompts and press submit!

+ My accountability buddies are very important to me, I learn so much from them as well as my fellow classmates.
+ Finding a better method for planning out my wireframes is something that would be very helpful when I get to the stages of appending elements to the DOM
+ Starting with a Constructor function set up from the begining must be a game changer, It's also helpful to know what is happening deeper within the code I am begining to appreciate the nuances of JavaScript.
+ I spent a lot of time learning the structure of a table trying to figiure out how to get one to manifest itself.
+ I need a good deal of practice styling websites, I learned in this lab Iam not as imaginative as I initially thought I was when I started this project.
