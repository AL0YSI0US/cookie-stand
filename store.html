<!-- Make two additional pages:

Mock up an order form that would be public facing (store.html) so that visitors to the website can order salmon cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you’d expect on an order form: name, address, payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.

A second ‘private’ page (order-processing.html) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that list item to a ‘Filled Orders’ list at the bottom of the page. -->
